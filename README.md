# LeetCode-Exercise-Attempts-CPP
Exercises attempted on the leetcode.com website.

This repository was built to exhibit my solutions that I used to solve some problems on Leetcode.com.
Note that some programs may output nothing - this was intentional because of the automation testing that the server used in order to validate the programs.

To compile any program, first clone the repository.
Next, use a terminal/console and change directory into the respective program you wish to try.
If using GCC, it is as simple as using:
g++ -g -o bin main.cpp
